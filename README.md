pdfshuffler-ng
==============

Advancing the development of PDF-Shuffler.

This is a for-private-use fork of "PDF-Shuffler 0.6" by Konstantinos Poulios from sourceforge.org [1] which is licensed under GPLv3 (or later). Unfortunately, many feature requests and bug reports have been filed over there and seem to remain due to inactive development of this gtk2-based branch.


The original README stated:
> This is the latest release of PDF-Shuffler, a simple pyGTK utility to merge, split and rearrange PDF documents. PDF-Shuffler lets also rotate and crop individual pages of a pdf document.

System Requirements
-------------------

* PyGTK
* python-poppler
* python-pypdf >= 1.10

Install
-------

pdfshuffler-ng
==============

Advancing the development of PDF-Shuffler.

This is a fork of "PDF-Shuffler 0.6" by Konstantinos Poulios from sourceforge.org [1] which is licensed under GPLv3 (or later). Unfortunately, many feature requests and bug reports have been filed over there and seem to remain due to inactive development.


The original README stated:
This is the latest release of PDF-Shuffler, a simple pyGTK utility to merge, split and rearrange PDF documents. PDF-Shuffler lets also rotate and crop individual pages of a pdf document.

PDF-Shuffler requires python-poppler and version 1.10 or newer of python-pypdf.

PDF-Shuffler is written in Python using PyGTK. It is released under the GNU GPL-3.

In order to install run:

> python setup.py install

as superuser.
